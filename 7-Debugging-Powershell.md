# Debugging Powershell with and without VS Code

- Find out variables and state
- Check under the "Run" command to see shortcuts for debugging
- Set breakpoints for debugging
- Step over vs Step into
  - Both do the same thing if there is no function call, if it is a regular line
  - Step into goes into a function call
  - Step over goes over the function call
- Step out comes out of a function
- Add to watch to watch a variable
- You can change the value of the variable
- Can add a condition for a breakpoint
  - It doesn't break everytime
  - maybe some value, or when it hits the point on the nth time
- Use the call stack to check your location
